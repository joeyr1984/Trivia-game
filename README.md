# Trivia-game

For This Assignment we were tasked with creating a JavaScript Quiz

Decided to have a little fun with this one. I Created a fake company called "DEWEY" like dewey decimal system that is a online repo for tutorials , quizes , etc for baby web developers. 

## The App includes:

* symantic HTML
* bootstrap for resonsiveness 
* javascript functionality that dynamicly updates the DOM with a timer and lets the user know when they got an answer wrong and local storage to display high scores. 

 ## Preview of the App
